    "paragraph": "Robsons Bodyworks began as a family-run collision shop in the UK in 1999, where Mark and Claire worked together from day one.

Today, with locations in both the UK and Canada, Robsons Bodyworks continues to provide top-notch vehicle repair services while staying true to the family values that have guided them since the start.",
